# WordPress Application

This is a WordPress application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Set Up WordPress:**

    Set up WordPress locally or on a server following the official WordPress installation guide.

3. **Configure WordPress:**

    Configure WordPress by setting up your database, configuring your `wp-config.php` file, and installing any necessary plugins or themes.

4. **Deploy WordPress:**

    Deploy your WordPress application using your preferred hosting platform or server.
## Configure PHPCS for WordPress coding standards:

WordPress has its own coding standards which PHPCS can enforce. Install WordPress Coding Standards for PHPCS using Composer:
 composer global require "squizlabs/php_codesniffer=*"
 composer global require wp-coding-standards/wpcs

Set the installed WordPress coding standards as the default:
## phpcs --config-set installed_paths ~/.composer/vendor/wp-coding-standards/wpcs

Integrate PHPCS checks into the CI pipeline:

Within the WordPress component's CI configuration file (e.g., .github/workflows/wordpress-ci.yml), add a step to run PHPCS:

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run PHPCS
        run: phpcs --standard=WordPress .
