# Go Application

This is a simple Go application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**

    Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile for the Go application and run the following command to build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t my-go-app .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:**

    Once the Docker image is built, you can run the Docker container using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 my-go-app
    ```

    Replace `8080:8080` with the desired port mapping if needed.
