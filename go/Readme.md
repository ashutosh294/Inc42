# Go Application

This is a simple Go application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**

    Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile for the Go application and run the following command to build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t my-go-app .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:**

    Once the Docker image is built, you can run the Docker container using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 my-go-app
    ```

    Replace `8080:8080` with the desired port mapping if needed.

4. **Access the Application:**

    You can now access your Go application by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

##   Implement GolangCI-Lint for the Go application:
Install GolangCI-Lint:

GolangCI-Lint is a fast Go linters runner. Install it using the following command:

curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.43.0
Configure GolangCI-Lint for Go coding standards:

GolangCI-Lint comes with a default set of linters. You can configure it further by creating a .golangci.yml file in the root of your Go project.
Integrate GolangCI-Lint checks into the CI pipeline:

## add a step in the Go component's CI configuration file to run GolangCI-Lint:
yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run GolangCI-Lint
        run: golangci-lint run
        
## Orchestration:
Create or Modify Docker Compose File
        
## Continuous Deployment:
Go Component:

Create a workflow file in the .github/workflows/ directory of your Go component's repository.
Name the file something descriptive like go-ci-cd.yml
